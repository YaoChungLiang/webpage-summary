## üîß Configuration

### API Key Setup

The extension requires an OpenAI API key to function. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Get API Key**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Edit File**: Open `background.js` in a text editor
3. **Replace Placeholder**: Change this line:
   ```javascript
   const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```
   To:
   ```javascript
   const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```
4. **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the reload button

### Cost Considerations

- **Free Tier**: OpenAI offers $5 free credit for new users
- **Pricing**: After free tier, costs ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- **Typical Usage**: A webpage summary costs approximately $0.01-0.05

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Content Script** (`content.js`): Injects UI elements and extracts webpage content
- **Background Script** (`background.js`): Handles API calls and message passing
- **Popup** (`popup.html/js/css`): Extension management interface
- **Manifest** (`manifest.json`): Extension configuration and permissions

### Content Extraction

The extension uses intelligent content extraction:
- Prioritizes semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<article>`, `.content`)
- Removes navigation, ads, and other non-content elements
- Limits content to 8000 characters for optimal API performance
- Falls back to body content if no main content area is found

### API Integration

- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (optimal balance of quality and cost)
- **Max Tokens**: 500 (sufficient for concise summaries)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Button Not Appearing**:
   - Check if extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
   - Reload the webpage
   - Ensure the extension has necessary permissions

2. **API Errors**:
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
   - Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
   - Ensure the API key has proper permissions

3. **Content Not Extracted**:
   - Some websites may block content extraction
   - Try on different types of websites
   - Check browser console for error messages

### Debug Mode

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click ‚Üí Inspect
2. **Check Console**: Look for error messages
3. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls are being made

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage**: The extension doesn't store any webpage content
- **Secure API**: All communication with OpenAI is encrypted (HTTPS)
- **Local Processing**: Content extraction happens locally in your browser
- **API Limits**: OpenAI has strict data usage policies and retention limits

## üöß Limitations

- **Content Length**: Very long articles may be truncated
- **Complex Layouts**: Some websites with complex layouts may not extract perfectly
- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript-heavy sites may require page reload
- **API Dependencies**: Requires active internet connection and OpenAI API access
